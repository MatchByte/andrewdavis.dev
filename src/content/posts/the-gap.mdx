The lifecycle of a developer's personal website is a reflection of the ever-evolving landscape of
web technologies. Mine is no exception, having gone from humble HTML and CSS beginnings through
Create React App and eventually landing on Gatsby. However, Gatsby has shown its age and I found
myself seeking a modern alternative. Enter [Astro](https://astro.build/) â€” a framework that has
breathed some new life into this site.
